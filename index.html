                    <h1>So...who am I?</h1>
                    <p>I am a senior at the University of Akron.  I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.  I have been writing code since age 9.  This is what I love to do, and I'd love to put my skills to work for you!</p>
                </li>

                    <h1>What am I trying to do?</h1>
                    <p>I'm trying to work with you on some awesome projects!  My primary focus at the moment is front-end website development.  I would love to work with you to create an amazing website that fits your needs!  No matter what your vision is, I will make it happen.  I will always provide excellent quality at affordable prices.

                    <h1>My Skillset</h1>
                    <p>Being a Computer Engineer, I have almost accidentally developed an incredibly broad range of skills.  If we're talking about desktop applications, I code in C++, C#, VB, MATLAB, Javascript, Java, Python, and Perl.  For web development, I am very comfortable with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.  I am learning more every day, and I'm even taking online courses from <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/jacobdemian">teamtreehouse.com</a> to accelerate my web development education!  Two subjects I'm currently diving into are SQL database management and Wordpress theme development.</p>

                <h2 class="quote">"I believe Jake's greatest strength is his ability to work independently and figure things out for himself.  Jake was able to accept a task with a small amount of guidance, investigate it himself, and then develop his own solution.  He learns quickly and can self-teach which will be very beneficial in the computer engineering field."</h2>
